Threat Intelligence Storage 

Downloading threat intelligence data isn't too hard.
Persisting it is a little trickier.

Threat intelligence can be shared using standards such as 
TAXII (to transmit), 
STIX (to represent meta data) and 
CYBOX (to represent observables).

there are a ton of things that aren't accurate after a first glance.
